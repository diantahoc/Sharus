Sharus is a .NET API Wrapper for MediaCrush-powered websites.

Documentation
---------------

Detailed documentation is coming soon. 

But to get started, Sharus is usable from the static Sharus class. 

All methods are somewhat self explanatory, and complex ones have in-line documentation.

Everything has been tested and confirmed to work. 

All methods throw WebExceptions (if applicable), as there is no network errors handling.

Dependencies
--------------

Sharus use the Newtonsoft JSON library - http://json.codeplex.com/.
